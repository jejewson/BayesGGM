# Bayesian computation for high-dimensional Gaussian Graphical Models with spike-and-slab prior

Code for examples in paper ''Bayesian computation for high-dimensional Gaussian Graphical Models with spike-and-slab prior'' by Sulem, Jewson, and Rossell.

  + The folder `simulations` contains code to run our mixing and inference simulations. The user needs only to specify the value of $n$ and $p$ of interest.
  + The folder `COVID` contains the data for our real example and the code to reproduce both our full data and cross-validation results
  + The folder `functions`s provides wrapper and utility functions for running the paper's methods and simplifying the notebook code

The paper's algorithms are implemented in the R package *modelSelection* (available on CRAN and https://github.com/davidrusi/modelSelection).
